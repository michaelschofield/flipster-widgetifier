# Flipster Widgetifier
## Because sometimes you just would rather create that `iframe` with javascript.

Hi, Michael here. Alrighty, so this wrapper -- at the moment (!) -- really only does one thing:
it lets you create the Flipster `<iframe>` widget and its settings with javascript. Just
pass a selector like this:

```
flipster.init( '#magazine-rack' );
```

My intention is to embellish this wrapper a little so that I can adjust the widget
based on location, screen width, or container size.
